* **`SN-1 scale.pdf`**: The complete 8-item subjective evaluation questionnaire used in our experiments.

## About the SN-1 Scale

The SN-1 scale is a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree) designed to validate the social compliance of the robot. 

According to our methodology, the scale comprises eight items addressing four key dimensions:

1.  **Distance Maintenance**
2.  **Position Selection**
3.  **Path Conflict**
4.  **Social Comfort**

### Reliability and Validity
The scale has been rigorously tested for reliability and validity in our study. 

**Data Collection Setup:**
The validation data was collected from human volunteers participating in two distinct experimental scenarios:
* **Dynamic Scenario 1:** Interactive cruising with **7 volunteers**.
* **Dynamic Scenario 2:** Interactive cruising with **10 volunteers**.

**Statistical Analysis Results:**
* **Internal Consistency:**
    * **Cronbach's $\alpha$:** $0.767$ (indicating satisfactory reliability)

* **Construct Validity (Factor Analysis Suitability):**
    * **KMO Measure of Sampling Adequacy:** $0.753$
    * **Bartlett's Test of Sphericity:**
        * Approx. Chi-Square ($\chi^2$): $126.57$
        * Degrees of Freedom ($df$): $28$
        * Significance ($p$): $< 0.001$
